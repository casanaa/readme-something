# readme-something

As a developer

I want a README generator

So that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

Given a command-line application that accepts user input

When I am prompted for information about my application repository

Then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

When I enter my project title

Then this is displayed as the title of the README

When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions

Then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

When I choose a license for my application from a list of options

Then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

When I enter my GitHub username

Then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

When I enter my email address

Then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

When I click on the links in the Table of Contents

Then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
